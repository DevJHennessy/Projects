<h1>Insertion Sort Algorithm</h1>

<p>In this C# console application, I made a public InsertionSort class with two methods, one that returns an array of integers and a second that returns an array of floats. In both methods, I use an inserion sort algorithm to sort an array of numbers. In the Program class's Main method, I instantiate the the InsertionSort class and call each sort method to sort two arrays, one of integers and another of floats, then display the sorted results to the console. I also created two NUnit tests, one for each method, to further my understanding of unit tests.</p>
