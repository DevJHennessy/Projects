<h1>Palindrome Exercise with NUnit test</h1>

<p>In this C# console application, I created a public Palindrome class with a public method that returns a bool to check if a string is a palindrome or not. In the method, I exclude characters that are not letters or digits in the string, and make sure use the To.Lower helper method on the characters being compared so that capitalization doesn't matter. I also created an NUnit test to check the strength of the IsPalindrome method and familiarize myself with NUnit testing.</p>
