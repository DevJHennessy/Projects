<h1>Twenty-one Card Game<h1>

<p>In this C# program, I created a working card game of Twenty-one using ASP.NET console applications. The console game starts by asking the user for their name, how much money they have to play with, if they want to play a game of twenty-one, and finally how much they wish to bet for the first game. If they player chooses to play and inputs an acceptable bet, then two cards are dealt to the player and to the house (the Dealer). First the player makes a number of moves, deciding the stay with the two cards they have or hit for another card until they either like their hand or bust, meaning going over twenty-one and thus automatically losing. If the player has twenty-one or below and stays, then the house takes a number of turns based on logic most casinos use. If the house busts, the player automatically wins, otherwise whoever is closest to twenty-one wins. The game keeps track of how much money the player has after each game, and as long as they have more than zero they can keep playing.</p>
