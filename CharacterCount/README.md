<h1>Algorithm to count character repition in strings</h1>

<p>In this C# console application, I created a public class called CharacterCount. In this class, I first made an empty string field called result. Next, I created a method that passes in and returns a string. Inside the method, I created an unassigned char variable and use that variabe in a for loop and assign it to 32 casted to char to start sorting through the 96 ASCII printable characters (32 being the starting point, equally a blank space). The loop continues as long as the casted character is less than or equal to 128. Inside this for loop I created a counter variable set to 0, then another for loop to increment the counter if the character is equal to the passed in character. The method keeps track and displays how many times a character appears in the string parameter. In the Program class's Main method, I instantiated the CharacterCount method and make a string variable with a random phrase to pass into the method, displaying the results to the console. I also practiced how to make a little more complicated unit test.</p>
